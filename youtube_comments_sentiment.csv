"Europeans confusion on burgers is so beyond me. A burger is ground meat formed into a patty it has nothing to do with the bun. You can eat a turkey burger on sliced white bread and the actual patty is still considered a burger therefore the sandwich is a burger. If it's not a ground Patty it is a sandwich especially if it is chicken it's a sandwich. Also sliders are small sandwiches regardless if it's a ground meat patty or not it's still called a slider if it's on a small bun. So if you have chicken breast, they're called chicken sliders. I see you guys call anything that has a hamburger bun a burger. A chicken sandwich is not a burger unless you grind it and make a patty out of it, then it's not a burger. It's a chicken burger. I see where it could be confusing but the basis is the fact that a burger is a ground patty. That's literally the only thing Europeans have to understand.. If it's not a ground Patty it's a sandwich, And if it's a small bun it's a slider",Neutral,0,False,0,2025-02-14 20:11:54

"Give your life to Jesus. Amen!

Trust in Jesus Christ, not antichrist.

I hope and pray that folks change their view and invite the Lord Jesus Christ into their life to rule and reign.

Satan is referred to as the prince of the power of the air for good reason, he owns the airwaves on planet earth and is the god (little g) of this world. It is my hope and prayer that you choose the God (Big G) of heaven who controls the destiny of your eternal soul.

(Matthew 10:28 > And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.)
+
(Proverbs 9:10 > The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.)

(2 Corinthians 4:3-4 > [3]-But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
[4]-In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.)

(Romans 10:9-10 > [9]-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[10]-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.)

(Romans 10:13 > For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.)

(Ephesians 2:8-9 > [8]-For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
[9]-Not of works, lest any man should boast.)

(Revelation 3:20 > Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.)

Is Jesus knocking at the door of your heart? Is this your opportunity for eternal salvation? If it is, I hope and pray that you open the door and invite Him in to your heart and life, in Jesus' name. Amen!

All glory be to God. Amen!
